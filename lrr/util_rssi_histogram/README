Lora Gateway RSSI histogram
===========================

1. Introduction
----------------

This software captures and computes the histogram of RSSIs on multiple channels.

2. Dependencies
----------------

loragw_reg
loragw_aux

3. Usage
---------

The histogram is computed over the following RSSI values: -137:1:-10 dBm
the RSSI comes from the output of the 125 kHz-wide channel 1
and is captured with the internal debug RAM of the concentrator which can record a maximum of 4096 points.
By default, on each channel, RSSI is captured over 3 seconds, which is done by doing 90 successive RAM captures,
the capture rate being set to 125kHz. This is repeated for channels from 863 to 870 MHz, by steps of 50 kHz.
The histogram is logged into a csv file (by default, "rssi_histogram.csv"), and the format is :
channel 1 frequency (MHz), RSSI value 1 (dBm), number of captured RSSI with value 1, RSSI val 2, hist of val 2, ..., RSSI val 128, hist ot val 128
channel 2 frequency (MHz), RSSI value 1 (dBm), number of captured RSSI with value 1, RSSI val 2, hist of val 2, ..., RSSI val 128, hist ot val 128
...

Command-line options:
 -h: help
 --file: log file name, default is "rssi_histogram.csv"
 --fmin: start frequency in Hz, default is 863 MHz
 --fmax: stop frequency in Hz, default is 870 MHz
 --fstep: frequency resolution in Hz, default is 50 kHz
 -n: number of RSSI captures, each capture is 4096 samples long, default is 90 (3s for 125kHz capture rate)
 -p: div ratio of capture rate (32 MHz/p), default is 256 (125 kHz)
