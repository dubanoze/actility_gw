Summary of commands available since LRC 1.0.28 LRR 1.2.10

Remote commands can be submitted from the CLI/telnet interface of the LRC. All of them are based on the unique ID of the LRR targeted (0804000c in examples).

In current version there are absolutely no returns for the remote commands, but
most of them have immediate effects on GUIs or wireless logger if they succeed.

LRR remote commands can be classified in two types; the embedded commands which are directly treated by the LRR process and the shell commands which are interfaces to shell script commands (shell/bash scripts).

Shell commands are performed through shell script files pre-existent on the LRR.
script files are searched in custom environment first (~/usr/etc/lrr_shell), then in default environment (~/lrr/com). By this way it is quiet easy to add 
or to customize commands.

For both types of commands, when options are available it is mandatory to insert a space character between selector (ex -V) and argument (1.2.10).

embedded commands :

common syntax from LRC CLI : 

	>>lrr command lrrid [options]

- restart the LRR process

	>>lrr restart 0804000c

- stop the radio thread of the LRR process

	>>lrr radiostop 0804000c

- start the radio thread of the LRR process, the radio board is reconfigured

	>>lrr radiostart 0804000c

- close the radio downlink direction (uplink packets are still received and transmitted to LRC, downlink packets from LRC are just ignored)


	>>lrr dnradiostop 0804000c

- open the radio downlink direction

	>>lrr dnradiostart 0804000c

shell commands :

These commands are performed through real shell script files pre-existent on
the LRR. The files are searched in custom environment first (~/usr/etc/lrr_shell), then in default environment (~/lrr/com). By this way it is quiet easy to add 
or to customize commands.

common syntax : 

	>>lrr shell lrrid command [options]

- reboot the computer hosting the LRR process

	>>lrr shell 0804000c reboot

- open / close a reverse ssh connexion, the default port number is 2009 and the
default destination is the Actility support computer

	>>lrr shell 0804000c openssh [-P port_number]

	>>lrr shell 0804000c closessh

- disable GPS location and force static values for latitude/longitude/altitude

	>>lrr shell 0804000c gpsman -LAT 2.0 -LON -3.0 -ALT 1000

- perform an upgrade of the LRR software

	>>lrr shell 0804000c upgrade -V 1.2.23
	<=>
	>>lrr upgrade 0804nd000c -V 1.2.23


- download a configuration tar file containing the 3 major ini files

	>>lrr shell 0804000c dnconfig [-C tar_config_files]

- remove a custom configuration ini file. If no file is specified all custom ini
files are removed, this returns to default configuration.

	>>lrr shell 0804000c rmcustomcfg [lrr.ini] [lgw.ini] [channels.ini] [gpsman.ini]


Details for command upgrade :

The upgrade command uses FTP protocol to download a tar file of the software.
By default the FTP server is hosted on the primary LRC port 21. The default 
login/password on the FTP server is ftp/<no password>.

The downloaded tar is controled via a md5 check given as an option or downloaded
via a special file.

A basic control is done on the number version to avoid to reinstall the same 
software version.

Upgrade can be forbidden by creating a file $ROOTACT/usr/etc/lrr/upgrade_locked 

If the procedure is successful the LRR process is restared.

Options :

-V A.B.C	download tar file lrr-A.B.C-wirmav2.tar.gz

-M md5_string	if not given a file lrr-A.B.C-wirmav2.md5 containing the md5
		must be present on the FTP server

-S system	change the name of the system software to download (ie wirmav2)
		Obviously not recommended

-F 1|2		1 : do not check version number
		2 : same as 1 and do not check if upgrade is locked

-A ftp_address	change the default FTP server address

-P ftp_port	change the default FTP server port

-U ftp_user	change the default FTP server user

-W ftp_password	change the default FTP server user password

Details for command dnconfig :
