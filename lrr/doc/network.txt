Network volume/load LRR <-> LRC
###############################

All sizes are relative to TCPIP/IEC104/LRR-LRC protocols, real sizes on physical 
networks such as 2/3/4G or satelitte are unknown. It is difficult to estimate
volume due to TCP retries and volume due to ACK/TCP and ACK/IEC window mechanism.


Lora
####

Lora packet size:
----------------

Overhead for TCP/IPv4 is : 40B

Overhead for IEC/104/APCI is : 6B

Overhead for LRR-LRC is : 49B
	- 20B for internal data (LRRid, protocol version, message type ...)
	- 29B for radio meta data (RSSI, SNR, times, channel, board, ...)

Total overhead is : 95B

Lora packet exchange:
--------------------

In case of low traffic each packet is acked at IEC and TCP level. When the load
increases window mechanism reduce the overhead due to ACKs at both level.

Total overhead is : 40B (tcp/ack) + 46B (iec/ack)


IEC
###

Each 20s the IEC protocol exchange test link message in both direction with the
primary and the secondary LRC.

This can be configured with:
	[laplrc:X]
		iec104t3=20


TCP
###

LRR uses standard TCP keepalive feature on sockets to the primary and the 
secondary LRC.

For the socket to the primary LRC, keepalive can be configured with:
 	[tcp]
		tcpkeepalive=1
		tcpkeepidle=5
		tcpkeepintvl=5
		tcpkeepcnt=3

For the socket to the secondary LRC, keepalive can be configured with:
 	[tcp]
		tcpkeepalivelow=1
		tcpkeepidlelow=5
		tcpkeepintvllow=30
		tcpkeepcntlow=3


LRR statistics and configuration reporting
##########################################

LRR send several statistics messages to primary and secondary LRC. The user sizes
of these messages are:
	- general stats: 210B
	- LRR config/stat report: 216B
	- LRR config/stat report by LRC: 71B (x2)
	- WAN config/stat report: 158B
	- WAN config/stat report by network interface: 35B (x2)
	- radio config/stat report: 40B

The frequencies of these reports can be configured with:

	[lrr]
		statrefresh=300
		configrefresh=86400
		wanrefresh=300
		rfcellrefresh=300
		

LRR round trip time calculation
###############################

For each network interface the LRR compute the RTT to the primary LRC by sending
ICMP packet with 4 data bytes every 60s.

The frequency can be configured with:

	[lrr]
		pingrttperiod=60

The feature can be deactivated by setting frequency to 0.
